  Extension for a better browser history
</p>

# How does it work?

The extension records your browsing history together with the content of the page you visited. All records are kept in your browser's storage (using IndexedDB) with full text indexing, so that using the extension you can search your history (of course including the content) pretty effectively.

# Is it safe?

All data is kept in your browser's storage, nothing is sent or shared. There are no trackers. No ads ever. And it will always be.

# Limitations

Suflog works for some <ins>particular websites.</ins> That is because each web page requries different content extraction logic. Currently supported websites are: Hackernews, Twitter, Reddit, Stackoverflow, Youtube and Github. Number of supported websites will be and can be increased relatively easily, PRs for new pages are always welcome.

# What content is saved?

Content extraction is hand-picked and it is different for every web site.
